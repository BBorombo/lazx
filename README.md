## Introduction
Lazx is a state-management library that makes it easy to handle reactive data, from your UI without having to think about how you will do it.

It's based on the **MVVM design pattern** and allows you to implement it in the easiest way possible.

You will not have to *handle many files, inherit many classes or think about the best way to implement it*, everything is done in a way that you just have to think about the logic and UI of your app, nothing more (and nothing less, I can't make your app for you 🤷‍♂️).

Enough talking let's jump into the concrete things 👇

## Usage
Coming soon. 🎬

## Examples
Under Development. 🏗

## Motivation

So... Why **Lazx** ?

I'm originally an Android Developer and I learned and practiced Flutter and really enjoyed it. 💙

The thing is that **I'm really lazy** and when it comes to make a good and strong architecture for your app in Flutter, it becomes a bit complicated and too greedy in ressources.

Depending on what you like (BloC, Redux, Provider...) you will have to create multiple files, handle multiples things, and I felt like I had to make **a whole logic and organization, just for the architecture and state management of my app**. 🤯

So after having done a few production apps with Flutter, I was really lazy to again, having to setup everything about architecture and state management.

In the other side, I had a really smooth structure for my apps in native Android development and really used to use it. As the other solutions in Flutter didn't really fit my needs and I couldn't find enough resources to use them at their fullest potential I finally decided to do the thing that every lazy person would do : **Make my own state management**. 🧐

That's how **Lazx** is born (with this fantastic and long searched name) 🐣
