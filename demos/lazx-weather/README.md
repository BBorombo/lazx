# Lazx Weather ‚òÄÔ∏è

Weahter app using Lazx lib. ü¶ã

## Getting Started

This project is a more advanced app using the Lazx lib. 

To make it works you should add a **.env** file at the root of the projet folder.
In this file you should add your (free) [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) API key like this : 
```
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=yourapikey
```

Don't forget to do a `pub get` before running the app!
